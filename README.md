# Project Overview

The Online Property Listing Portal project aims to revolutionize the property buying and selling process by eliminating brokers as intermediaries and streamlining online transactions. Designed with user-friendliness in mind, the platform simplifies property negotiations and agreements through intuitive terms and icons, making the entire process more accessible and efficient.

The project integrates the MERN stack with React.js and Spring Boot to deliver a comprehensive, secure, and user-centric property listing solution.
