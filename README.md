# Project Overview

The Online Property Listing Portal project aims to revolutionize the property buying and selling process by eliminating brokers as intermediaries and streamlining online transactions. Designed with user-friendliness in mind, the platform simplifies property negotiations and agreements through intuitive terms and icons, making the entire process more accessible and efficient.

The project integrates the MERN stack with React.js and Spring Boot to deliver a comprehensive, secure, and user-centric property listing solution.

This project serves as a practical demonstration of the skills and knowledge acquired during the PG-DAC (Post Graduate Diploma in Advanced Computing) course. It showcases the application of learned concepts in a real-world scenario, integrating various technologies and methodologies to create a comprehensive property listing solution.

# Technology Stack:

**Front-End:** Developed using React.js for a dynamic user interface, enhanced by React-Redux for efficient state management. This combination ensures a responsive and seamless user experience.

**Back-End:** Built with Spring Boot to provide robust and secure RESTful APIs. Spring Security is integrated to safeguard user data and ensure secure transactions.

# Key Features:
1. Direct Transactions: Facilitates direct communication between buyers and sellers, bypassing traditional broker involvement.

2. Simplified Negotiations: Uses user-friendly terms and visual icons to streamline property discussions and agreements.

3. Secure Platform: Incorporates advanced security measures to protect user data and transactions.
